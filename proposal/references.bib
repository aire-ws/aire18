abstract = {Inspection is one of the most valuable tools the software engineer has available, but the technology is not being exploited to its full potential. We define an enhanced inspection technique called phased inspection that addresses the deficiencies of existing inspection techniques. The most important goal of phased inspection is rigor, so that engineers can trust the results of a specific inspection and inspection results are repeatable. We also present details of a toolset that supports phased inspection by providing the inspector with as much computer assistance as possible and by checking for compliance with the required process of phased inspection. Experimental evaluations of phased inspections lead us to conclude that the goals are being partially achieved and that further refinement of the checklists used and process structure will permit further improvements in inspection efficiency (18 Refs.)},
